        "My primary research has been concentrated on Burns Bog, a raised domed peat bog siutated in Metro Vancouver. The bog is equipped with two Eddy covariance (EC) stations, a mobile flux tower and multiple chamber sites. In my role as an undergraduate research assistant, I conducted research in quantifying greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes within zones of the bog that experienced fire events in 2005 and 2016, as well as in an unburned zone. Theses measurements were executed employing static chamber - gas chromatography method. \n",
        "\n",
        "For my masterâ€™s thesis, I am investigating the impacts of seedlings removal on soil respiration (CO_2 and CH_4) within the zone of the bog that was burned in 2016, utilizing the static chamber-portable analyzer technique. Concurrently, I have a strong interest in the modeling of EC data. This interest inspired me to undertake a project aimed at exploring the influence of heatwaves on GHG fluxes (CO_2 and CH_4) by employing gap-filled flux data derived from the EC systems located in the bog.\n",

        "On July 3, 2016, a fire broke out in the north-western portion of the Burns Bog at the base of one of the Corus Entertainment radio towers, which consumed up to 78 hectares of the bog area. The fire resulted in the incineration of up to 50 cm of the surface peat, the area was subjected to massive seed releases from decades of accumulation of lodgepole pinecones.The post-fire vegetation communities became tree-dominated, mainly comprising native and non-native tree species. This in turn increases soil carbon emissions to the atmosphere and can decrease the carbon storage capacity of peatlands.\n",
        "\n",
        "Appropriate postfire management (seedling removal) is hypothesized to protect the carbon sequestration potential of peatlands by preventing their transition to a forest ecosystem. This study aims to investigate the impacts of seedling removal on soil and ground-level respiration (both CO_2 and CH_4) within a burned section of Burns Bog.\n",
        "\n",
        "The study focuses on two distinct study areas (seedling area and seedling-removal area) located within the 2016 burned zone of the bog. Within each study area, three distinct study ecosystem types (Pine Sphagnum Low Shrub/Tall Shrub/Woodland) have been identified. Six collars were installed at each of the six chamber sites. \n",
        "\n",
        "The manual measurements include: CO_2 and CH_4 fluxes by using LI-COR 7810 gas analyzer; peat volumetric water content and temperature at depths of 5cm and 10cm beside each collar; water table depth at each monitoring well across all study sites\n",
        "The continuous measurements include: continuous water table depth across various ecosystem types; continuous temperature at 5, 10, and 30 cm below the peat surface; continuous water content at sites representing one specific ecosystem type.\n",
