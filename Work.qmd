Here is a sampling of some of the things I've been working on.  

# Research & Field Work


Through my career I've done field work all over the world, from pine plantations in New Zealand to tundra sites in the Mackenzie Delta region of the Northwest Territories.  Presently, I am primarily focused on managing a collection of eddy covariance (EC) stations in Burn's Bog in Delta, BC.

## Mobile BBS Flux Tower

In early summer 2023 I designed and deployed a light-weight EC system mounted on a telescoping tripod to measure CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes in stand of lodgepole pine seedlings in Burns Bog that sprouted following a fire in 2016.


## Flux Footprint Mapping

I've developed a python based tool for creating flux footprints web maps using the Kljun et al. (2015) flux footprint model.  The maps for our field sites are shown in the image below.  You can click the list sites on the left to zoom to site and see the flux footprint climatology for the site.  The tool also has the capability to include a vegetation map for the site to better estimate the flux contribution by different source/sink area

* I'm still working on preparing/documenting the code for broader distribution.  I'll post a link here when its ready :D

## Arctic Carbon Fluxes

:::

For my PhD research, I studied carbon fluxes in wetland ecosystem in the Mackenzie Delta Region.  I conducted two field seasons of research.  In 2016 I worked at Illisarvik, an artificially drained thermokarst lake on Richard's Island, NWT.  Then in 2017 I installed an EC station at Fish Island, a low-center polygon ecosystem in the Mackenzie River Delta.


# Teaching

I have been working as a sessional instructor at UBC since 2020.  In November 2022, I was given an "Open Educational Resource Champion" award for publishing all my course materials as Open Educational Resource (OER) on Github.  

* I feel this is the most effective, transparent, and accessible way I can provide content for my students.
* I find the institutional tools provided by UBC (e.g., Canvas) to be lacking in functionality and flexibility;  they also pose an obvious barrier to accessibility.  
* By using Github I can tailor my course webpage as I see fit, prospective students can review this syllabus and other content to see if they might be interested in the course, and students will continue to have access the course content even after they graduate!

## Courses


From Summer 2020 to Summer 2023, I taught Geographic Information Science.  You can find the website for the most recent term of the course [here](https://geos270.github.io/).  As of Fall 2023, I am teaching "Atmospheric Environments", which is an introductory level course focusing on the dynamics governing the weather and climate.  The course website can be found [here](https://geos200.github.io/).  In Winter 2023, I will be teaching "Microscale Weather and Climate", an upper level course focusing on ecosystem scale weather and climate dynamics and how they influence the global climate system.
 

## Evaluations

All of my available teaching evaluations are posted [here](https://github.com/June-Skeeter/june-skeeter.github.io/tree/main/Evaluations).  Thus far these evaluations only cover GEOS 270 (Geographic Information Science).

* The wording of the evaluation questions has changed between terms, but one key question has not changed: **Considering everything, how would you rate this course?**  The chart and table below summarize my student's responses.

```{python}
#| label: fig-evals
#| echo: false
#| cap-location: margin
#| fig-cap: "Student repsones to the question: Considering everything, how would you rate this course?"

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Evals = pd.read_csv("Evaluations/Considering_everything_how_would_you_rate_this_course.csv")

Summary = Evals[['Very Poor','Poor','Neutral','Good','Very Good']].sum()
Evals['Response Rate'] = (Evals['n']/Evals['N']).round(2)
# Evals['Favorability'] = Evals[['Good','Very Good']].sum(axis=1)/Summary.sum()
Terms = Evals['N'].count()

fig,ax = plt.subplots(1,1,figsize=(6,4))
ax.bar(Summary.index,Summary,facecolor='#3248a8',edgecolor='k')
ax.grid(axis='y')
ax.set_ylabel('Total Responses')
ax.set_title('Summary of my Teaching Evaluations')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
