I am an Master student at the University of British Columbia, Geography Department, Micrometeorology Lab. I received a BSc in Environmental Science from the University of British Columbia in 2022.Currently, as a second-year MSc student, I am examining the impacts of seedling removal — a post-fire management practice — on the GHG fluxes (CO2 and CH4) within the 2016 burned zone of the Burns Bog, Delta, BC. This research utilizes a smart chamber with a portable analyzer. Additionally, I am interested in quantifying the net carbon exchange at the ecosystem scale using eddy covariance techniques and understanding carbon dynamics across varying ecosystem types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m an avid programmer I am fluent in Python and functionally proficient in a number of other languages including JavaScript, R, and Matlab. I love making maps and enjoy creating interactive, web-based applications for research and education. I prefer to work with open source options whenever possible because accessibility of information, transparency in data analysis, and minimizing barriers to access are central to my research and pedagogical philosophies."

    "text": "This webpage was created using Quarto and is hosted using Github Pages. Quarto is an open source scientific writing package that helps you write articles, create presentations, and publish websites. It supports integration with Python and R, and can render .pdf, .docx, .html, .pptx files and multiple other types of documents.\nIf you want to make your own, the first step is to download and install Quarto. It can be run in RStudio or VSCode (along with other apps). To learn more about Quarto websites visit https://quarto.org/docs/websites.\nTo host a personal website you need to create a github repository using this format:\n\nUser-Name.github.io\nThis isn’t necessary to host a regular webpage with github, only if you want to make a “homepage” for yourself. i.e., the repo for this site is: https://github.com/June-Skeeter/june-skeeter.github.io, so when the page is rendered it shows up as https://june-skeeter.github.io/\nYou can use other naming conventions if you don’t need this. i.e., the here is a repo hosted on the micromet github: https://github.com/ubc-micromet/FieldSiteMaps, and the corresponding github page address is https://ubc-micromet.github.io/FieldSiteMaps/\n\nThis should mostly work as is, provided you install Quarto. To render the .pdf version of the CV template you will also need LaTeX installed. I use the XeTeX engine which I you can find here; you can also try installing “TinyTex” instead directly through Quarto by typing this command in the termina:\n’‘’console quarto install tinytex’’’\nThis template also uses the quarto package Section Bibliographies Filter - I’ve included it in this repo (under _extensions) because I’ve altered it slightly from its orignal format. It should work as is? But you may need to install it with first then replace with the updated version.\nDon’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions."
