I am a Master student at the University of British Columbia, Geography Department, Micrometeorology Lab. I received an Honours degree in Environmental Science from the University of British Columbia in 2022. Currently, as a second-year MSc student, I am examining the impacts of seedling removal — a post-fire management practice — on the GHG fluxes (CO2 and CH4) within the 2016 burned zone of the Burns Bog, Delta, BC. This research utilizes a smart chamber with a portable analyzer. Additionally, I am interested in quantifying and modelling the net carbon exchange at the ecosystem scale using eddy covariance techniques and understanding carbon dynamics across varying ecosystem types.\n\n\n\n\nWhat do I think of myself?\nI am hardworking and dedicated to completing each task carefully and to the highest standard\nI am open to hearing different perspectives and suggestions\nI value foresight and enjoy making advance preparations\nI am passionate about learning, and possess strong critical thinking and writing skills, coupled with effective teamwork abilities\n\n\nPlease check my research page for detailed information on what kinds of research I’ve done and am currently working on!"

    "text": "Master Thesis - Investigating Impacts of Seedling Removal on Soil Respiration (CO_2 and CH_4) in a Restored Bog Ecosystem\n\n\n\nOn July 3, 2016, a fire broke out in the north-western portion of the Burns Bog at the base of one of the Corus Entertainment radio towers, which consumed up to 78 hectares of the bog area. The fire resulted in the incineration of up to 50 cm of the surface peat, the area was subjected to massive seed releases from decades of accumulation of lodgepole pinecones.The post-fire vegetation communities became tree-dominated, mainly comprising native and non-native tree species. This in turn increases soil carbon emissions to the atmosphere and can decrease the carbon storage capacity of peatlands. Appropriate postfire management (seedling removal) is hypothesized to protect the carbon sequestration potential of peatlands by preventing their transition to a forest ecosystem. This study aims to investigate the impacts of seedling removal on soil and ground-level respiration (both CO2 and CH4) within a burned section of Burns Bog. The study focuses on two distinct study areas (seedling area and seedling-removal area) located within the 2016 burned zone of the bog. Within each study area, three distinct study ecosystem types (Pine Sphagnum Low Shrub/Tall Shrub/Woodland) have been identified. Six collars were installed at each of the six chamber sites. The manual measurements include: CO2 and CH4 fluxes by using LI-COR 7810 gas analyzer; peat volumetric water content and temperature at depths of 5cm and 10cm beside each collar; water table depth at each monitoring well across all study sites. The continuous measurements include: continuous water table depth across various ecosystem types; continuous temperature at 5, 10, and 30 cm below the peat surface; continuous water content at sites representing one specific ecosystem type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing portable analyzer and smart chamber for fluxes measurements\n\n\n\n\n\nMe fixing the water pipe clogged issue\n\n\n:::"

Based on the WMO’s survey on extreme events frequency in 2022, heat waves were the most commonly occurring event relative to others (117/477). However,our knowledge of the impacts of these extreme temperature events on ecosystem functions is still limited.\n\n\nBy integrating the definitions of heatwaves from both the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and De Boeck et al. (2010), we identified seven periods of heatwaves since the construction of the Burns Bog EC flux tower in 2016. We have conducted preliminary statistical analyses to understand the alterations in magnitude and patterns of FC and FCH4 before, during, and after the heatwave, and to identify the biophysical controls influencing FC and FCH4 during these phases. Presently, we’re researching the use of information theory (mutual information and transfer entropy) to investigate dominant controls and causal interactions between the fluxes and their primary drivers under heatwave events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegularly participate in EC tower maintenance"

    "text": "Honours Thesis - Postfire greenhouse gas exchange of three vegetation types in a restored bog ecosystem\nUnder a warming climate, degraded peatlands are facing increased frequency and extent of peat fires, which can turn peatlands from net carbon (C) sinks to net C sources. The Burns Bog experienced two recent serious wildfires, one in 2005 and another in 2016.\nIn this study, we used static chambers - gas chromatography to measure GHG fluxes at three dominant vegetation types in the 2005 and 2016 fire zones and an unburned area. Our goals were (a) quantify postfire GHG fluxes of three representative vegetation types in three zones experiencing different fire events and (b) investigate the effects of fire and time since fire on GHG exchanges in BBECA over 8 months (from October 2021 to May 2022).\nMain findings include 1) Among all ecosystem types studied, sites characterized as Pine Sphagnum Woodland, particularly those with a higher density of trees, were identified as stronger sources of CO2 and weaker sources of CH4 and 2) N2O fluxes were found to be negligible across all investigated sites in the bog.\n\n\n\nPoster Presentation for Honours Thesis\n\n\n\n\n\nSampling at the study site"
